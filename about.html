    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-title">
        I'm Enoch, a self-taught and aspiring full stack web developer. I graduated college in 2021 with a
        degree in Electrical Engineering, but later found that my interests and passion aligned more with 
        software engineering instead.
